   - **ReportingAgent**: Documentation and report generation

3. **Agent Orchestrator** (`redcalibur/ai_core/orchestrator.py`)
   - Multi-agent coordination
   - Workflow execution
   - Agent handoffs
   - Execution history tracking

## 🎯 Running the Demo

### Basic Demo (Automated)
```bash
python demo_agents.py
```

This runs two complete workflows:
1. **Comprehensive Penetration Test** on example.com
2. **OSINT Reconnaissance** on testcompany.com

### Interactive Demo
```bash
python demo_agents.py interactive
```

You can specify your own target and objective.

### Individual Agent Demo
```bash
python demo_agents.py individual
```

Test each agent separately.

## 📊 What You'll See

### Agent Workflow
```
Planner Agent
   ↓ (Plans strategy)
Recon Agent  
   ↓ (Gathers intel)
Exploit Agent
   ↓ (Tests vulnerabilities)
Reporting Agent
   ↓ (Documents findings)
```

### Output Includes
- ✅ Agent reasoning (observations, analysis, plans)
- ✅ Tool selection and parameters
- ✅ Execution results
- ✅ Memory tracking
- ✅ Workflow summary

## 🎓 For Professor Presentation

### Key Points to Highlight

1. **AI-Driven Automation**
   - Agents think through problems using reasoning
   - Autonomous tool selection
   - Context-aware decision making

2. **ReACT Pattern Implementation**
   - Think: Analyze situation and plan
   - Act: Execute chosen action
   - Observe: Learn from results

3. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Agents work together on complex tasks
   - Handoffs between specialized agents
   - Shared context and memory

4. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add new agents
   - Simple tool integration
   - Modular architecture

### Demo Script

```bash
# 1. Show available agents
python demo_agents.py

# 2. Run interactive demo with custom target
python demo_agents.py interactive
# Enter: demo.testfire.net
# Enter: Find security vulnerabilities

# 3. Show individual agent capabilities
python demo_agents.py individual
```

## 📞 Questions Professors Might Ask

**Q: Is this just calling existing tools?**
A: No, this is an AI orchestration layer that reasons about which tools to use, when, and how. The agents make intelligent decisions based on context.

**Q: How is this different from automated scanners?**
A: Traditional scanners follow fixed scripts. Our agents use reasoning to adapt their strategy based on observations, similar to how human pentesters work.

**Q: Can you add real LLM integration?**
A: Yes! The architecture is designed for it. The `think()` method can call any LLM API. I've kept it simple for the demo but can show the integration points.

**Q: How does the multi-agent coordination work?**
A: The orchestrator manages agent lifecycle, passes context between agents, and tracks execution history. Each agent specializes in one phase and hands off to the next.

**Q: What's the ReACT pattern?**
A: It's Reasoning + Action - agents observe the situation, reason about it, plan actions, execute them, then observe results. It's inspired by recent AI research papers.
