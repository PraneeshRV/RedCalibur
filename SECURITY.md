## Security Considerations

RedCalibur is designed with security in mind:

- **API Key Protection**: Environment variables for sensitive data
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Input Validation**: Sanitized inputs to prevent injection attacks

## Responsible Use

- Only use against systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Follow all applicable laws and regulations
- Respect rate limits and target system resources
- Use for educational and authorized testing purposes only

## Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed and fixed.
