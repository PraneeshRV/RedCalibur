    RedCalibur implements a MULTI-AGENT AI SYSTEM inspired by recent research:
    - HexStrike AI (MCP-based agent framework)
    - PentAGI (Autonomous pentesting agents)
    - CAI Framework (ReACT pattern for cybersecurity)
    
    Key Innovation: Agents that REASON about security testing, not just
    execute scripts.

    💡 ReACT = Reasoning + Action
    
    Each agent follows this cycle:
    
    1. THINK (Reasoning Phase)
       - Observe the current situation
       - Analyze what's needed
       - Plan the next steps
       - Assess confidence
    
    2. ACT (Action Phase)
       - Select appropriate tool
       - Determine parameters
       - Execute action
    
    3. OBSERVE (Learning Phase)
       - Store results in memory
       - Update context
       - Inform next iteration
    
    This mimics how human pentesters work!

    3. Agent Memory
       → Agents remember previous actions and results
    
    4. Context Passing
       → Information flows between agents
    
    5. Tool Framework
       → Abstraction for 20+ security tools
    
    6. State Management
       → Track agent states (idle, thinking, acting, completed)
    
    7. Workflow Orchestration
       → Automated agent handoffs and coordination

    🆚 Traditional Pentesting Tools vs RedCalibur
    
    Traditional Tools (Nmap, Metasploit):
    • Fixed scanning sequences
    • No reasoning or adaptation
    • Manual coordination required
    • No context awareness
    
    RedCalibur Multi-Agent System:
    ✓ Adaptive reasoning
    ✓ Autonomous coordination
    ✓ Context-aware decisions
    ✓ Learning from results
