## 🔧 How It Works

### AI Integration Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Your Gemini API Key (.env)            │

```

### Example: AI-Powered Reasoning

**Input to Planner Agent:**
```python
{
    'objective': 'Find SQL injection vulnerabilities',
    'target': 'webapp.example.com'
}
```

**AI-Generated Output:**
```
## Strategic Analysis: SQL Injection Vulnerability Assessment

This penetration testing engagement focuses on webapp.example.com, 
likely utilizing a database backend. The objective implies focus on 
areas where user input interacts with the database (login forms, 
search bars, URL parameters).

Recommended phases: Reconnaissance → Vulnerability Scanning → 
Exploitation → Reporting

The ReconAgent will identify subdomains and technology stack. 
ExploitAgent will use sqlmap and nuclei to test injection points. 
Success criteria: Identify and demonstrate at least one exploitable 
SQL injection vulnerability.

Risks: WAF limitations, input validation, legal boundaries...
```

## 📊 AI vs Rule-Based Comparison

| Feature | Rule-Based (Old) | AI-Powered (NEW) |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Reasoning | Fixed templates | Dynamic, contextual |
| Adaptation | None | Adapts to target type |
| Analysis Depth | 2-3 sentences | Multiple paragraphs |
| Context Awareness | Limited | Full context understanding |
| Tool Selection | Fixed sequence | Intelligent prioritization |
| Report Quality | Template-based | Professional, detailed |

## 🎯 Testing AI Capabilities

### Test Individual Agent AI

```python
from redcalibur.ai_core.agents import PlannerAgent

agent = PlannerAgent()
print(f"AI Enabled: {agent.use_ai}")  # Should be True
print(f"Model: {agent.llm.model_name}")  # models/gemini-2.0-flash

result = agent.execute({
    'objective': 'Your objective here',
    'target': 'your-target.com'
})

# View AI-generated analysis
thought = agent.memory[0]['thought']
print(thought.analysis)  # Full AI reasoning!
```

### Test Full Workflow

```bash
# Automatic demo (2 workflows)
python demo_agents.py

# Interactive with custom target
python demo_agents.py interactive

# Individual agents
python demo_agents.py individual
```

---

## 🔑 Configuration

The system automatically detects your Gemini API key from `.env`:


### Fallback Behavior

If API key is missing or invalid:
- Agents automatically fall back to rule-based mode
- System continues working (no crashes)
- You'll see: "📋 Rule-Based Mode" instead of "🤖 Gemini AI Enabled"

---

## 💡 AI-Powered Features

### 1. Contextual Analysis
Agents understand the full context:
- Target type (domain, IP, URL, webapp)
- Objective nuances (SQL injection vs XSS vs recon)
- Previous agent findings
- Security concerns and risks

### 2. Intelligent Tool Selection
AI chooses tools based on:
- Target characteristics
- Engagement objectives
- Detection avoidance needs
- Expected outcomes

### 3. Professional Reporting
AI generates:
- Executive summaries for management
